Strengths:

"One of my key strengths is my proficiency in ReactJS and front-end development. I’m also a problem-solver and quick learner, which helps me adapt to new technologies and project requirements. Finally, I have strong collaboration skills, which allow me to work well in teams and communicate effectively with different stakeholders."

-

Technical Proficiency: "I have strong expertise in ReactJS and front-end development, which allows me to build efficient, scalable applications. I'm also skilled in integrating with APIs and ensuring that the front-end communicates effectively with the backend."

Problem-Solving Skills: "I enjoy tackling complex issues and breaking them down into manageable solutions. This helps me troubleshoot bugs quickly and improve the overall performance of the application."

Adaptability: "I’m quick to learn new technologies and adapt to project requirements. Whether it’s picking up a new framework or addressing shifting client needs, I can adjust without losing momentum."


- I'm a great team player 


Weaknesses:



"I tend to overcommit at times, taking on multiple tasks, which can lead to feeling overwhelmed. However, I’ve been working on improving my time management and setting clearer priorities to maintain a better balance."

-

Impatience with Slow Processes: "I sometimes get frustrated when processes, like approvals or deployments, take longer than expected. I’m working on being more patient and understanding that some things take time."

Overcommitting: "I tend to take on multiple tasks to help the team, which can sometimes lead to feeling overextended. I’ve been focusing on better time management and setting clearer priorities."

Difficulty Saying 'No': "I find it hard to say no to additional tasks, which can sometimes lead to overextension. I’m learning to balance my workload and set healthy boundaries."

One of my weaknesses is taking on too much work. I’m a team player and like to help others out, but I’ve realized that it’s better for me to say ‘no’ to some requests so that I don’t overextend myself. I’ve started assigning due dates for my to-do list so I know if I can take on my work, and if I can, to set a realistic timeframe with other parties.”

What’s your biggest weakness?


Sample Answer:

One thing that frustrates me the most about myself is that that I find it really hard to say no to people. If somebody asks me to help them, I will always say “yes”. The problem is, I sometimes take too much on,
and I then get overwhelmed. Although I am very hard-working, and I will always help when I am able to, I
am learning to think before I say yes to everything!
