"While I’ve enjoyed my time at Bigscal,but I’m looking for new challenges and growth opportunities. I want to be in an environment where I can take on more responsibility, explore new technologies, and contribute to larger, more dynamic projects."


another answer:


 “While I valued my experiences there, I felt that I had reached a point where I needed to explore a different industry that aligns more closely with my long-term career goals.”

  Be honest but positive. Focus on seeking new challenges, growth opportunities, or alignment with my career goals.
