Where do you see yourself after 5 years?



	In 5 years, I see myself as a senior ReactJS developer or a tech lead, working on more complex and impactful projects. I aim to expand my expertise in frontend technologies, contributing to high-performance applications while mentoring junior developers. I also want to gain more experience in full-stack development to become more versatile and able to lead end-to-end project development.
