Tell me about a time you worked in a team.



"In my current role as a ReactJS frontend developer, I worked closely with a cross-functional team on the ShipManager QHSE project. I collaborated with backend developers, QA engineers, and project managers to build a user-friendly interface for the ship safety management system. We faced a tight deadline, so clear communication and effective teamwork were crucial. 

I focused on ensuring smooth data integration with the backend and optimized the UI for performance. By working closely with the team and maintaining open communication, we successfully delivered the project on time and met all the clientâ€™s requirements."
