tell me something that not on your CV

"One thing that’s not on my CV is that I’m passionate about continuous learning and staying up-to-date with the latest industry trends. 

I spend a lot of my free time exploring new tools and frameworks, not just limited to ReactJS but also other front-end technologies that could improve my work.

 For instance, I’ve recently been experimenting with design systems and improving my skills in UI/UX design to create more intuitive(UI) interfaces. 

 This ongoing learning really fuels my passion for innovation and problem-solving."
