Tell me about your time management skills?
------------------------------------

- I am very effective at time management. I am the type of person who is extremely organised and knows what they want to achieve during each day. 

I like to keep lists, which act as a reminder of what I want to achieve and in what timeframe. For example, if I have a busy schedule planned for the forth coming week, I will always write down what I want to do during that week, the week before.

 This allows me to plan ahead and also makes sure that I have everything in place so that I can achieve each objective.

 I fully understand that the role I am applying for will require me to be competent at time management, and I am fully prepared for this
