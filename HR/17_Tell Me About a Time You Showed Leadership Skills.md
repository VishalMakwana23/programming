Tell Me About a Time You Showed Leadership Skills.

"In one of my previous projects, I was leading a small team of developers working on a critical feature with a tight deadline. 

I took the initiative to break down the tasks, assign responsibilities based on each team member's strengths, and ensure we stayed on track. 

I regularly checked in with the team, provided guidance when needed, and facilitated open communication to address any issues quickly. 

By fostering collaboration and keeping the team motivated, we successfully delivered the feature ahead of the deadline, with minimal bugs. This experience taught me the importance of clear communication and delegation when leading a team."
