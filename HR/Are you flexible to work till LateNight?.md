Are you flexible to work till LateNight?
-------------------------------------
- I understand that flexibility is important in the workplace, and I am open to working late nights when needed. I am willing to adjust my schedule and make myself available during evening and night shifts, as well as on weekends if required. I believe that being adaptable and accommodating to the needs of the company is crucial for success.
