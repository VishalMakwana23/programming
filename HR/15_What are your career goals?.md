What are your career goals?



My primary goal is to deepen my expertise as a ReactJS developer and stay updated with the latest trends and technologies in front-end development. Over the next few years, I aim to take on more leadership responsibilities, such as mentoring junior developers and contributing to architectural decisions.

 In the long term, I would like to grow into a full-stack developer, expanding my backend knowledge to create more end-to-end solutions and eventually transition into a technical leadership role where I can drive innovation and contribute to the overall direction of projects.
