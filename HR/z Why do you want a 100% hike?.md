 Why do you want a 100% hike?

	Answer:

I believe that the 100% hike reflects the value I bring based on my experience and the skills I’ve developed over the years, particularly in ReactJS and frontend development. In my current role, I've consistently delivered high-quality work, contributed to key projects, and taken on significant responsibilities, such as solving complex technical issues and improving performance. Additionally, I’ve invested in continuous learning to stay updated with industry trends, which adds to the overall value I can offer. This hike represents not just my past contributions but also my potential to drive even more success in this new role.
