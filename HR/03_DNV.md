(Mobile Inspection App)

During my tenure as a React JS developer at ShipManager QHSE, I had the opportunity to contribute to the development of a mobile inspection app aimed at locally managing various aspects of the Ship safety management system. This app was designed to streamline the workflow of onboard safety inspections, findings, and actions, providing a seamless and efficient solution for the maritime industry.

In addition, I utilized IndexedDB for managing reports and the state of the app, providing a robust and efficient method for storing and retrieving data locally. This approach enhanced the app's performance and responsiveness, especially in scenarios where internet connectivity was limited or intermittent.

Overall, my involvement in the development of the mobile inspection app for ShipManager QHSE allowed me to contribute to the advancement of safety protocols and compliance processes within the maritime industry, leveraging the power of React JS to create impactful solutions for the company.
