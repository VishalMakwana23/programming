What do you think were your biggest achievements in your React js development


"In my ReactJS development career, one of my biggest achievements was successfully optimizing the performance of a large-scale web application by implementing advanced techniques like lazy loading, code splitting, and improving component reusability. This resulted in faster load times and a more seamless user experience. Additionally, I played a key role in developing complex data visualizations using libraries like D3.js and Cytoscape.js, which enhanced how users interact with data.
