"I worked on a mobile app called 'Healthray,' developed using React Native. It's designed for patients who want to consult their physicians remotely through HIPAA-compliant secure video calls. 

The app allows users to manage health profiles for themselves and their family members, store digital health records, and access consultation notes, prescriptions, and more.

 It offers instant online consultations with specialists across various fields, as well as the ability to book appointments. 

 Healthray simplifies healthcare by providing a one-stop solution for doctor consultations and medical record management, making it convenient and accessible for users to take care of their health without having to visit a clinic physically."
