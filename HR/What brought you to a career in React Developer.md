* - What brought you to a career in React Developemnts?

	Answer:

	I was drawn to React development because of its component-based architecture, which makes building user interfaces more modular and efficient. I initially started with other front-end frameworks but found React’s flexibility, performance optimization, and strong community support to be a game-changer. 

	The ability to build reusable components and manage application state efficiently through React really appealed to me, as it allowed me to focus on creating high-quality, dynamic user experiences. That’s what motivated me to specialize in React, and it has continued to excite me throughout my career.
