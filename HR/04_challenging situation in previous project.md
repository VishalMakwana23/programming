Can you describe a challenging situation you faced in a previous role and how you handled it?



"In a previous project (Close Digital protection), I faced a challenging situation when implementing graph visualizations using Cytoscape.js. The goal was to show complex relationships between different entities while ensuring the digital protection of sensitive data. The challenge was in efficiently rendering the relationships while maintaining the clarity and performance of the graph, especially with large datasets.

To tackle this, I optimized how the data was processed and rendered, using lazy loading and efficient graph layout algorithms to improve performance. I also worked closely with backend teams to ensure that data was securely transferred and appropriately handled on the frontend. In the end, I was able to create an interactive and efficient graph visualization that met both performance and security requirements."





Tell me about a challenge you faced at work and how you dealt with it.

Answer:
"In my current role, we faced a challenge when integrating a complex API for real-time data synchronization. I collaborated with the backend team to understand the issues, and we worked together to optimize the data flow. I also adjusted the frontend to handle edge cases, which resulted in a more reliable user experience and smoother application performance."
