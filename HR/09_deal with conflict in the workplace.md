* - Describe how you deal with conflict in the workplace.

		Answer:
		"When dealing with conflict in the workplace, I believe in approaching the situation calmly and professionally. My first step is always to listen carefully to all parties involved to understand the root cause of the disagreement. I focus on finding common ground and fostering open communication, as many conflicts arise from misunderstandings or miscommunications.

		If the conflict involves a difference of opinion on a technical matter, I prefer to rely on data and objective analysis to guide the resolution. I also try to keep the focus on the project’s goals and how we can collaborate to achieve the best outcome for the team and the company.

		In cases where a conflict might escalate, I’m not hesitant to involve a mediator, such as a manager, to ensure that the situation is resolved fairly and constructively. My ultimate goal is to resolve conflicts in a way that strengthens team collaboration and maintains a positive work environment."
