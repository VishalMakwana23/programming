 What would you do if you realized two weeks after starting work here it wasn’t for you?



	Answer:
	I genuinely don’t believe that will happen. I have researched your company, your values, the strong
	customer feedback you have online and also the duties and responsibilities I will have each day. This is the job for me, and I am 99% sure I will be very happy and fulfilled here, if you go ahead and hire me.
