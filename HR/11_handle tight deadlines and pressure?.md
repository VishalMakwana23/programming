* - How do you handle tight deadlines and pressure?

	Answer:
	"I handle tight deadlines and pressure by staying organized and breaking tasks into smaller, manageable steps. 

	I prioritize the most critical features and communicate closely with my team to ensure everyone is aligned on goals and timelines. 

	I’m comfortable working under pressure and focus on maintaining quality while meeting deadlines. I also stay flexible, so if priorities change or unexpected issues arise, I can adjust without losing focus."


* - Can you give an example of when you have worked well under pressure?

	Answer:

	"In a previous project, we faced a tight deadline to deliver a major feature for the ShipManager QHSE system. The feature involved complex data visualizations, and we encountered several technical challenges. 

	Despite the pressure, I stayed focused, collaborated closely with the team, and prioritized tasks effectively.

	 By breaking the problem into smaller components and using React’s performance optimization techniques, I was able to deliver the feature on time without compromising quality. This experience taught me how to stay calm, manage stress, and focus on solutions when working under pressure."

* - Tell me about a time when you went above and beyond for a project.

	Answer:
	"During a critical phase of the ShipManager QHSE project, we were facing a tight deadline, and there were some issues with the front-end integration. I took the initiative to work extra hours to troubleshoot and fix the issues. I also collaborated closely with the backend team to ensure smooth communication between the two systems. This extra effort helped us deliver the project on time without compromising on quality."



* - How do you handle multitasking?

	"Multitasking is part of every developer’s job, and I manage it by staying organized and prioritizing tasks based on urgency and importance. I make use of tools like Jira Azure devOps, and Trello to track tasks and ensure I’m not missing deadlines. If I have multiple projects to handle at once, I allocate time blocks to focus on one task at a time, ensuring each gets the attention it needs."
