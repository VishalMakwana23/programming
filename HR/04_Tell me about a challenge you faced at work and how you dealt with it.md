Tell me about a challenge you faced at work and how you dealt with it.

Answer:
"In my current role, we faced a challenge when integrating a complex API for real-time data synchronization. I collaborated with the backend team to understand the issues, and we worked together to optimize the data flow. I also adjusted the frontend to handle edge cases, which resulted in a more reliable user experience and smoother application performance."
