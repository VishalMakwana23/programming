How do you prioritize your work?
------------------------------------

- I keep a daily and weekly planner to track all of my tasks, and this helps me prioritize my work as well. Each morning, I look through my planner and make sure it aligns with any new or urgent priorities. For example, if I know we have a presentation on Wednesday, then I will have a reminder for Tuesday morning to touch base and make sure everything is ready.


Tell me about your time management skills?
------------------------------------

- I am very effective at time management. I am the type of person who is extremely organised and knows what they want to achieve during each day. I like to keep lists, which act as a reminder of what I want to achieve and in what timeframe. For example, if I have a busy schedule planned for the forthcoming week, I will always write down what I want to do during that week, the week before. This allows me to plan ahead and also makes sure that I have everything in place so that I can achieve each objective.I fully understand that the role I am applying for will require me to be competent at time management, and I am fully prepared for this

the job for me, and I am 99% sure I will be very happy and fulfilled here, if you go ahead and hire me.
