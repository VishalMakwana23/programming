* - How do you manage a team?

	Answer:

	"In managing a team, I focus on clear communication, collaboration, and setting realistic goals. I ensure that everyone understands their roles and responsibilities, while also encouraging open discussions to solve challenges together. I like to break down tasks into manageable pieces and use tools like Agile boards to track progress and ensure deadlines are met. I prioritize regular check-ins to offer support where needed, and I believe in fostering a positive environment where team members feel comfortable sharing ideas and taking ownership of their work."
